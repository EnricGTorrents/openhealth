Data Collection and Analysis Manual for Open Source Research and Development Project on Mental Health

Data Collection

The cornerstone of our open-source research and development project on mental health is an exhaustive data collection strategy designed to capture a wide range of behavioral and environmental metrics. This comprehensive approach employs a diverse set of hardware resources, each contributing unique types of digital fingerprints to the overall dataset. The aim is to construct a multi-dimensional behavioral signature for each individual, which can later be leveraged by predictive algorithms for mental health assessments and interventions. Standardized protocols will be established for each type of digital fingerprint to ensure consistency and reliability in data collection. The frequency of data collection will be tailored to the specific type of digital fingerprint, ranging from real-time capture for GPS data to periodic snapshots for CCTV footage.
